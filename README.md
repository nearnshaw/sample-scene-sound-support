# Sound support

This is an example of how you can use sound in a scene.

The example also shows how you can dynamically change the color of tiles randomly at a regular interval.


You can learn more about these things in our documentation: https://docs.decentraland.org/

[explore the scene](https://dcl-project-lolxizhsmy.now.sh/?position=-1%2C-1): this link takes you to a copy of the scene deployed to a remote server where you can interact with it. You can also achieve the same by following the steps below and running it locally.

**Install the CLI**

Download and install the Decentraland CLI by running the following command

```bash
npm i -g decentraland
```

For a more details, follow the steps in the [Installation guide](https://docs.decentraland.org/documentation/installation-guide/).


**Previewing the scene**


Once you've installed the CLI, download this example and navigate to its directory from your terminal or command prompt.

_from the scene directory:_

```
$:  dcl preview
```

Any dependencies are installed and then the CLI will open the scene in a new browser tab automatically.
